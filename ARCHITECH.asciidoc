- **Distractor Integration**:
  - Utilize the `DistractorPool` to select plausible incorrect options, enhancing question variety and challenge.
- **Progress Tracking**: 
  - After each `QuizAttempt`, update the `UserProgress` table to increment `quizzes_completed` and, if passed, `quizzes_passed`.
  - Assess cumulative quizzes to determine eligibility for difficulty level upgrades.
  
- **Badge Assignment**:
  - Assign badges for milestones, such as passing all beginner-level quizzes in a category.
  - Update the `UserProgress` table and `UserBadge` records accordingly.

=== Answer Validation and User Progress Tracking
- **Answer Submission**: Validate the selected option against the correct answer in the `Option` table.
- **Progress Update**: Update `QuizAttempt` entries with metrics like correct answers and total time taken. Calculate `accuracy` to reflect user retention and progress.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Provide immediate feedback on answer correctness, along with hints if enabled.

=== Example Quiz Request and Response Flow

When a user sends a quiz request:

1. **Request**: Contains the desired category and difficulty level.
2. **Response**: The backend returns:
   - `quiz_id`: Identifier for the quiz.
   - `difficulty_level`: Level of the quiz (e.g., "intermediate").
   - `category`: Quiz category, like "Greetings".
   - `num_questions`: Total number of questions in the quiz.
   - `time_limit`: Allowed time for the quiz.
   - `questions`: JSON array of question objects, where each question has:
     - `question_id`: Identifier.
     - `prompt`: Text of the question.
     - `options`: List of option texts, shuffled on each request.
   - `passing_criteria`: Number of correct answers needed to pass.
   
The backend dynamically shuffles options and questions on each quiz request, ensuring each attempt feels unique while retaining the underlying quiz structure.

=== Progress Tracking and Analytics
- After each quiz attempt, `QuizAttempt` is updated with time taken, total correct answers, and calculated accuracy.
- Users can view past attempts to identify areas needing improvement.
- Analytics dashboards for administrators to monitor user engagement and content effectiveness.

   - `accuracy`: Calculated as `total_correct / num_questions`
   - `passed`: Boolean indicating if the quiz met the passing criteria (based on correct answers)

=== Key Algorithms and Quiz Flow

#### Quiz Generation and Start
- When a user initiates a quiz, they provide `Category` and `Difficulty` preferences.
- The backend retrieves a matching `Quiz` object based on category and difficulty level, with a JSON array of question IDs for the set.
- Questions and options are shuffled:
  - **Question Order**: The list of questions in the quiz is randomized.
  - **Option Order**: For each question, the position of the four options is also shuffled.
  - This ensures users cannot memorize option patterns to pass the quiz without learning.

#### Answer Validation and User Progress Tracking
- **Answer Submission**: When a user submits an answer for a question, the backend checks `is_correct` in the `Option` table to validate it.
- **Progress Update**: `QuizAttempt` entries are updated per quiz attempt, storing metrics such as the number of correct answers and total time taken. The `accuracy` field helps users gauge their retention and progress in each category and difficulty level.

=== Example Quiz Request and Response Flow

When a user sends a quiz request:
1. **Request**: Contains the desired category and difficulty level.
2. **Response**: The backend returns:
   - `quiz_id`: Identifier for the quiz.
   - `difficulty_level`: Level of the quiz (e.g., "intermediate").
   - `category`: Quiz category, like "Greetings".
   - `num_questions`: Total number of questions in the quiz.
   - `time_limit`: Allowed time for the quiz.
   - `questions`: JSON array of question objects, where each question has:
     - `question_id`: Identifier.
     - `prompt`: Text of the question.
     - `options`: List of option texts, shuffled on each request.
   - `passing_criteria`: Number of correct answers needed to pass.

The backend will dynamically shuffle options and questions on each quiz request, which allows each attempt to feel unique while retaining the underlying structure of the quiz.

#### Progress Tracking and Analytics
- After each quiz attempt, `QuizAttempt` updates with time taken, total correct answers, and calculated accuracy.
- Users can view past attempts to identify areas needing improvement.

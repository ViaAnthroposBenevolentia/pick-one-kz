= SPEC-1: Language Translation Quiz Game
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

The Language Translation Quiz game is designed as an interactive tool to aid language learners, specifically targeting users interested in practical Kazakh phrases. The primary goal is to create an engaging experience that supports tourists, students, and language enthusiasts in building a foundational vocabulary. Through multiple-choice quizzes and progressive difficulty levels, users can learn at their own pace while tracking improvement over time.

The game aims to serve as an accessible entry point into language learning by focusing on essential, everyday phrases, making it an effective tool for users who are new to the language or have limited time to dedicate to structured study. Additionally, with features like immediate feedback, hints, and leaderboards, the game encourages regular practice and fosters a sense of achievement.

This phased approach to features ensures a steady progression from foundational to advanced levels, allowing for skill development and user retention.


== Requirements

The Language Translation Quiz game has a set of core features and enhancements to support user engagement and effective learning. Requirements are organized by priority to guide initial development and future scaling.

=== Must Have
- **Multiple-Choice Translation Quizzes**: Enable users to select the correct Kazakh translation for English phrases with four choices, focusing on practical, everyday phrases.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Provide instant confirmation on user responses to encourage retention and learning.
- **User Profiles**: Allow each user to have a profile that tracks accuracy, speed, and overall progress over time.
- **Backend and Frontend Setup**: Set up Django and Django Ninja for backend API management and Svelte for a responsive, user-friendly frontend interface.
- **Database Management**: Use PostgreSQL to store user data, quiz questions, translations, and progress tracking information.

=== Should Have
- **Difficulty Levels**: Add beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, with beginner as the default to accommodate new users.
- **Hints Feature**: Include a hint button offering subtle clues to assist users without revealing the answer directly.
- **Progress Tracking and Analytics**: Allow users to review their performance, track milestones, and identify areas for improvement.
- **Local Leaderboard**: Display a leaderboard to foster friendly competition among users.

=== Could Have
- **Global Leaderboard with Challenges**: Introduce a global leaderboard and periodic challenges to gamify the experience and encourage engagement.
- **Mobile and Offline Access**: Optimize for mobile and enable offline access for on-the-go learning.
- **Social Sharing**: Provide users with the option to share quiz results or progress on social media to promote the app.

=== Won't Have
- **Advanced Language Pair Options**: Expanding beyond Kazakh-English translations may be outside the initial project scope.


== Method

The Language Translation Quiz game leverages a modern web architecture for a seamless, responsive user experience. The following subsections describe the technical components of the system, including the backend, frontend, database, and essential algorithms for managing quizzes, user progress, and accuracy tracking.

=== System Architecture

The system is based on a client-server model:
- **Frontend**: Svelte framework will manage user interaction, providing a highly interactive experience. The app will dynamically load quiz questions, display feedback, and update the user’s profile in real-time.
- **Backend**: Django with Django Ninja will handle the API, processing requests for quiz data, user profiles, accuracy, and leaderboard information. The RESTful API structure facilitates efficient client-server communication, while Django Ninja ensures type-safe endpoints for reliable API responses.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is chosen for its robustness in handling relational data. It will store structured data on users, quiz content, hints, accuracy, and speed tracking, with relationships that allow for complex querying as the app scales.

== Indexes and Optimization

1. Create indexes on key columns, such as `user_id`, `question_id`, and `category_id`, to improve query performance.
2. Implement a composite index on `difficulty_level` and `category_id` in the `Question` table if queries frequently filter by both fields.

   
=== Key Algorithms and Quiz Flow

#### Quiz Generation and Start
- When a user initiates a quiz, they provide `Category` and `Difficulty` preferences.
- The backend retrieves a matching `Quiz` object based on category and difficulty level, with a JSON array of question IDs for the set.
- Questions and options are shuffled:
  - **Question Order**: The list of questions in the quiz is randomized.
  - **Option Order**: For each question, the position of the four options is also shuffled.
  - This ensures users cannot memorize option patterns to pass the quiz without learning.
- **Progress Tracking**: 
   - After each `QuizAttempt`, update the `UserProgress` table to increment `quizzes_completed` and, if passed, `quizzes_passed`.
   - Check the user's cumulative quizzes to determine if they meet criteria for difficulty level upgrades.

- **Badge Assignment**:
   - For milestones such as passing all beginner-level quizzes in a category, assign a badge.
   - Update the `UserProgress` table to mark `badge_awarded` as `True` and log the specific `badge_id` in the user profile.

#### Answer Validation and User Progress Tracking
- **Answer Submission**: When a user submits an answer for a question, the backend checks `is_correct` in the `Option` table to validate it.
- **Progress Update**: `QuizAttempt` entries are updated per quiz attempt, storing metrics such as the number of correct answers and total time taken. The `accuracy` field helps users gauge their retention and progress in each category and difficulty level.

=== Example Quiz Request and Response Flow

When a user sends a quiz request:
1. **Request**: Contains the desired category and difficulty level.
2. **Response**: The backend returns:
   - `quiz_id`: Identifier for the quiz.
   - `difficulty_level`: Level of the quiz (e.g., "intermediate").
   - `category`: Quiz category, like "Greetings".
   - `num_questions`: Total number of questions in the quiz.
   - `time_limit`: Allowed time for the quiz.
   - `questions`: JSON array of question objects, where each question has:
     - `question_id`: Identifier.
     - `prompt`: Text of the question.
     - `options`: List of option texts, shuffled on each request.
   - `passing_criteria`: Number of correct answers needed to pass.

The backend will dynamically shuffle options and questions on each quiz request, which allows each attempt to feel unique while retaining the underlying structure of the quiz.

#### Progress Tracking and Analytics
- After each quiz attempt, `QuizAttempt` updates with time taken, total correct answers, and calculated accuracy.
- Users can view past attempts to identify areas needing improvement.

== Implementation

This section outlines the implementation steps needed to build the Language Translation Quiz Game. Each step details the core components, API endpoints, and the flow for handling quizzes, tracking user progress, and managing categories.

=== Step 1: Backend Setup with Django and Django Ninja

     - **Option**
     - **Quiz**
     - **User**
     - **QuizAttempt**
     - **UserProgress**
     - **Badge**

3. **Migrations**:
   - Run migrations to set up the database schema.

4. **API Setup with Django Ninja**:
   - Configure Django Ninja for RESTful API management.
   - Set up type-safe endpoints for quiz generation, question validation, user profile retrieval, leaderboard data, and progress tracking.
   - Include endpoints for retrieving badges and checking progress toward level or badge achievements.

=== Step 2: Key API Endpoints

The following endpoints will handle the main functionalities of the quiz game:

1. **Endpoint: Start Quiz**
   - **URL**: `/api/quiz/start`
   - **Method**: `POST`
   - **Request Body**: `{ "category_id": int, "difficulty_level": "string" }`
   - **Response**: Returns a quiz object with questions and options, shuffled for randomization.
   - **Process**:
     - Retrieve or generate a `Quiz` object based on `category_id` and `difficulty_level`.
     - Create a `QuizAttempt` entry for tracking progress.
